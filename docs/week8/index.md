Week 8 – Oscillations

Welcome to Week 8 of College Physics 201. This module introduces oscillatory motion, focusing on physical systems where a restoring force leads to periodic motion. You will learn how to analyze oscillations mathematically, interpret energy relationships, and apply oscillation concepts to springs, pendulums, and damped systems.

Learning Objectives

By the end of Week 8 you should be able to:

Identify systems that exhibit simple harmonic motion (SHM)

Use the SHM equations
