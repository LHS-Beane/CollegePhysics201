Physical Quantities, Units, and Measurement Core IdeaDeeper ReasoningAdvanced Application <p>Physics describes the world using measurable quantities: - length, time, mass, temperature, etc. - each must have a unit (meters, seconds, kilograms, kelvins\u2026)</p> <p>We use the SI (International System of Units) as a common language.</p> Quantity Unit Symbol Length meter m Mass kilogram kg Time second s Temperature kelvin K Electric current ampere A <p>Visual from your slides:</p> <p></p> <p>A \u201cnumber\u201d without a unit is meaningless in physics.</p> <p>Compare: - \u201cThe car went 30\u201d \u2192 30 what? - \u201cThe car went 30 m\u201d vs \u201c30 mi\u201d vs \u201c30 km\u201d \u2192 very different physical situations.</p> <p>Units also hide physical scales: - meters vs nanometers vs light-years - seconds vs microseconds vs years  </p> <p>Your slide likely showing different scales:</p> <p></p> <p>This helps students see that the same laws apply from atoms to galaxies.</p> <p>When you later do more advanced physics (EM, quantum, thermo), being sloppy with units leads to: - wrong answers - confusion about what an equation actually means - difficulty catching mistakes</p> <p>Habit to build now: - Always write the unit next to your answer. - Always check if unit types \u201cmatch\u201d on both sides of equations.</p> 2. SI Prefixes and Unit Conversions (Factor\u2013Label Method) Core IdeaDeeper ReasoningAdvanced Application <p>We use prefixes to handle very large or small numbers:</p> Prefix Symbol Factor kilo k \\(10^3\\) mega M \\(10^6\\) giga G \\(10^9\\) milli m \\(10^{-3}\\) micro \u03bc \\(10^{-6}\\) nano n \\(10^{-9}\\) <p>From your slides:</p> <p></p> <p>We do conversions using the factor\u2013label method (multiplying by 1 cleverly).</p> <p>Example: Convert 60 mph to m/s</p> \\[ 60\\ \\frac{\\text{mi}}{\\text{hr}} \\cdot \\frac{1609\\ \\text{m}}{1\\ \\text{mi}} \\cdot \\frac{1\\ \\text{hr}}{3600\\ \\text{s}} = 26.8\\ \\text{m/s} \\] <p>Each \u201cconversion factor\u201d is just a fancy version of:</p> \\[ \\frac{\\text{same quantity in different units}}{\\text{same quantity in original units}} = 1 \\] <p>So we are multiplying by 1, but in a way that changes units.</p> <p>In more advanced problems, you might convert: - km/h to m/s - g/cm\\(^3\\) to kg/m\\(^3\\) - J to eV (electron-volts)</p> <p>Practice problem:</p> <p>Convert \\( 3.5\\ \\text{g/cm}^3 \\) into kg/m\\(^3\\).</p> Show Solution \\[ 3.5\\ \\frac{\\text{g}}{\\text{cm}^3} \\cdot \\frac{1\\ \\text{kg}}{1000\\ \\text{g}} \\cdot \\left(\\frac{100\\ \\text{cm}}{1\\ \\text{m}}\\right)^3 = 3.5 \\cdot \\frac{1}{1000} \\cdot (10^6) = 3500\\ \\frac{\\text{kg}}{\\text{m}^3} \\] 3. Dimensions and Dimensional Analysis Core IdeaDeeper ReasoningAdvanced Application <p>Dimensions represent the type of quantity, not the unit.</p> <ul> <li>Length: \\([L]\\)</li> <li>Time: \\([T]\\)</li> <li>Mass: \\([M]\\)</li> </ul> <p>Examples: [ \\text{Velocity} : [L][T^{-1}] ] [ \\text{Acceleration} : [L][T^{-2}] ] [ \\text{Force} : [M][L][T^{-2}] ]</p> <p>You can use dimensions to check if an equation could possibly be correct.</p> <p>Suppose someone proposes:</p> \\[ v = 3t + 7x \\] <ul> <li>Left-hand side: \\(v \\rightarrow [L/T]\\) </li> <li>Right-hand side:</li> <li>\\(3t \\rightarrow [T]\\)</li> <li>\\(7x \\rightarrow [L]\\)</li> </ul> <p>You cannot add \\([T]\\) and \\([L]\\). Therefore, the equation is nonsense physically.</p> <p>Dimensional analysis doesn\u2019t prove an equation is right, but it can tell you if it\u2019s definitely wrong.</p> <p>Often, we know: - the relevant quantities (e.g., \\(g\\), \\(h\\), \\(v_0\\)), and - the dimension we want (e.g., time [T])</p> <p>Dimensional analysis can guide us to plausible forms of relationships.</p> <p>It\u2019s also very helpful in checking your work in exams.</p> <p>Visual from your slides:</p> <p></p> 4. Position and Displacement Along a Line Core IdeaDeeper ReasoningAdvanced Application <p>Position \\(x(t)\\) tells you where an object is along a 1D axis. Displacement is the change in position:</p> \\[ \\Delta x = x_f - x_i \\] <p>It can be positive (forward), negative (backwards) or zero.</p> <p>From your Ch. 3 slides:</p> <p></p> <p>Position depends on your choice of origin. If you choose \\(x=0\\) at one place vs another, the numeric values change, but physics does not.</p> <p>Displacement cares only about start and end, not the path taken.</p> <p>If \\(x(t)\\) is given as a function (e.g., a polynomial), we can: - compute displacement over a time interval: \\(x(t_2)-x(t_1)\\) - compute average velocity: \\(\\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta t}\\)</p> <p>Example:</p> <p>[ x(t) = 2t^2 - 4t + 1 ] From \\(t=1\\) to \\(t=3\\):</p> \\[ \\Delta x = x(3)-x(1) \\] Show Solution <p>[ x(3)=2(9)-4(3)+1=18-12+1=7 ] [ x(1)=2(1)-4(1)+1=2-4+1=-1 ] [ \\Delta x = 7 - (-1) = 8\\ \\text{m} ]</p> 5. Average vs Instantaneous Velocity Core IdeaDeeper ReasoningAdvanced Application <p>Average velocity over a time interval:</p> \\[ \\bar{v} = \\frac{\\Delta x}{\\Delta t} \\] <p>Instantaneous velocity is the velocity at one instant:</p> \\[ v(t) = \\frac{dx}{dt} \\] <p>On a position\u2013time graph: - average velocity \u2194 slope of a secant line - instantaneous velocity \u2194 slope of the tangent line</p> <p>From your slides:</p> <p></p> <p>Average velocity is like \u201coverall change\u201d: \u201cFrom 1:00 to 1:05, my position changed by 500 m, so on average I moved 100 m/min.\u201d</p> <p>Instantaneous velocity zooms in on one time: \u201cExactly at 1:02:30, what was my speed and direction?\u201d</p> <p>Conceptual graph from your slides:</p> <p></p> <p>Given: [ x(t) = t^3 - 4t + 2 ]</p> <ul> <li>Average velocity from \\(t=1\\) to \\(t=2\\)</li> <li>Instantaneous velocity at \\(t=1\\)</li> </ul> Show Solution \\[ v(t) = \\frac{dx}{dt} = 3t^2 - 4 \\] <p>Average from 1 to 2:</p> <p>[ x(2) = 8 - 8 + 2 = 2 ] [ x(1) = 1 - 4 + 2 = -1 ] [ \\bar{v} = \\frac{2 - (-1)}{2-1} = 3\\ \\text{m/s} ]</p> <p>Instantaneous at \\(t=1\\):</p> \\[ v(1) = 3(1)^2-4 = -1\\ \\text{m/s} \\] <p>Negative means motion is in the negative direction at that instant.</p> 6. Acceleration: Changing Velocity Core IdeaDeeper ReasoningAdvanced Application <p>Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity:</p> \\[ a(t) = \\frac{dv}{dt} \\] <p>On a velocity\u2013time graph: - the slope is the acceleration</p> <p>Slide illustration:</p> <p></p> <p>There are several ways velocity can change: - speed increases - speed decreases - direction reverses</p> <p>All of these involve acceleration, even if the speed is momentarily zero.</p> <p>For constant acceleration: [ a = \\text{constant} \\Rightarrow v(t) = v_0 + at,\\quad x(t) = x_0 + v_0 t + \\frac{1}{2}at^2 ]</p> <p>Suppose: [ a(t) = 6t,\\quad v(0) = 3,\\quad x(0)=0 ]</p> <p>Then: [ v(t) = \\int 6t\\,dt = 3t^2 + C ]</p> <p>Using \\(v(0)=3\\): [ 3(0)^2 + C = 3 \\Rightarrow C = 3 ]</p> \\[ v(t) = 3t^2+3 \\] <p>Then: [ x(t) = \\int (3t^2+3)\\,dt = t^3 + 3t + C_2 ]</p> <p>Using \\(x(0)=0\\) gives \\(C_2=0\\).</p> \\[ x(t) = t^3 + 3t \\] 7.
