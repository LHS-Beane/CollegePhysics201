        <p class="mt-1">
          To get the best estimate of the constant velocity from noisy experimental data, you draw a
          <em>best-fit line</em> that represents the average trend of all the points over the entire interval.
          The student whose red line passes closest to most points and spans the full time (rather than just
          connecting two arbitrary points or using only a subset) will produce the most accurate velocity.

        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Depends on the exact spacing in the motion diagram; verify from the figure.</p>
        <p class="mt-1">
          In a motion diagram, <em>increasing spacing</em> between dots means the speed is increasing (acceleration
          in the direction of motion), and <em>decreasing spacing</em> means speed is decreasing (acceleration opposite
          the direction of motion). Look at how the spacing changes before and after <em>t</em> = 3 s to determine the sign
          of the acceleration in each region.

        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> B</p>
        <p class="mt-1">
          Constant acceleration means the <em>change in velocity per unit time</em> is constant.
          Here, \(a = \Delta v / \Delta t = 9.8\,\text{m/s}^2\), so each second the speed increases by 9.8 m/s.
          The distance fallen each second does <em>not</em> stay constant; it increases as the object speeds up.

        <p class="mt-1">
          At the top of its trajectory, the object is instantaneously at rest, so
          \(v = 0\). However, gravity still acts downward with magnitude \(g = 9.8\,\text{m/s}^2\), so the

        <p><strong>Answer (conceptually):</strong> The correct diagram has weight down, normal up, and a friction force to the <strong>left</strong>.</p>
        <p class="mt-1">
          In the ground frame, the crate is slowing down while moving right, so its acceleration is to the left.
          The only horizontal force that can produce this acceleration is static friction between the crate and the
          floor, directed to the left. There is no forward “inertia” force in a Newtonian free-body diagram.
          Choose the picture that shows \(mg\) downward, \(N\) upward, and static friction leftward.

        <p class="mt-1">
          The velocity–time graph typically levels off by about <em>t</em> = 3 s, meaning the filter has reached
          terminal velocity. At terminal velocity, net force is zero: the downward gravitational force \(mg\) is

        <p class="mt-1">
          For a spring–mass system, the total energy is \(E = \tfrac12 k A^2\).  
          To double \(E\) while holding amplitude fixed, you must double \(k\): then
          \(E' = \tfrac12 (2k)A^2 = 2E\).  
          Doubling amplitude would give \(E' = \tfrac12 k (2A)^2 = 4E\), i.e., four times the energy.
          The mass does not appear in the expression for total energy (given fixed amplitude).

          For a rigid body of fixed moment of inertia \(I\), the rotational analog of Newton’s second law is
          \(\tau_\text{net} = I\alpha\). If \(\alpha\) is constant and \(I\) is constant, then the net torque must

          In the usual version of this problem, the blocks in orientation II are farther from the central axis

          Use the work–energy theorem  
          \(K_i + U_{gi} + W_\text{other} = K_f + U_{gf}\).  
          From the height–time graph, infer whether the ball is speeding up or slowing down between the initial and
          final states and how its gravitational potential energy changes. Then check which bar charts are consistent
          with those changes and with the sign of the work done by non-gravitational forces.

        <p><strong>Answer (physics):</strong> \(v_t \propto \sqrt{N}\), so the correct graph is increasing and concave down.</p>
        <p class="mt-1">
          At terminal velocity, drag (proportional to \(v^2\)) balances weight \(mg\), which is proportional to the number
          of filters \(N\). Thus \(k v_t^2 \propto N \Rightarrow v_t \propto \sqrt{N}\).
          This gives a curve that increases with \(N\) but flattens (concave down). Choose the graph that looks like a
          square-root function.

        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> B</p>
        <p class="mt-1">
          With no friction, mechanical energy is conserved. Both swimmers start at the same height, so they
          lose the same amount of gravitational potential energy \(mgh\), which becomes kinetic energy
          \(\tfrac12 m v^2\) at the bottom. Thus \(v = \sqrt{2gh}\) is the same for any path between the
          same initial and final heights.

        <p><strong>Answer (typical):</strong> C — if the positive and negative areas under the force–time curve cancel.</p>

          The change in momentum is the impulse:

        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> C</p>
        <p class="mt-1">
          The passenger’s momentum must change from its initial value to near zero in the crash; the impulse
          \(\Delta p\) is essentially fixed by the change in velocity. Since
          \(\Delta p = F_\text{avg}\,\Delta t\), increasing the stopping time \(\Delta t\) reduces the average
          force \(F_\text{avg}\). Air bags accomplish this by allowing the passenger to come to rest over a longer
          distance and time, reducing peak forces.

        <p><strong>Answer:</strong> D</p>
        <p class="mt-1">
          In an isolated two-object collision, the internal forces between the objects are equal and opposite.
          The impulses on each object are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction, so the magnitude of the
          momentum change \(|\Delta p|\) is the same for both. The car typically experiences a much larger <em>acceleration</em>
          because it has the smaller mass, but the magnitude of momentum change is equal.
